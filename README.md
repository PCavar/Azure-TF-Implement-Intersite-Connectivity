Knowledge wise you must be familiar with simple Terraform commands

Steps to proivision:
    1. Preferably download the repository
   
    2. Make sure you are signed in to your Azure account and have set the right subscription to provision resources to.

    3. Running "terraform init" Initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.

    4. Running "terraform fmt" rewrites Terraforms configuration files to a canonical format and style. good for readability.
   
    5. Running "terraform validate" checks the syntax and internal consistency of Terraforms configuration files.
   
    6. Running "terraform plan" creates an execution plan and displays what will be deployed when running "terraform apply".
   
    7. Running "terraform plan -out ./run-this-deployment.tfplan" creates an execution plan and saves it to the file specified.
   
    8.  Running "terraform apply -out ./run-this-deployment.tfplan" applies the deployment/changes proposed in "./run-this-deployment.tfplan".


There are many more commands, for starters this will be more than enough!


Have fun!
